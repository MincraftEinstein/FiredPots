### **üìò Description**

When decorated pots were first shown off at Minecraft Line 2020, they were made by placing a clay pot above a fire.
This mod recreates that by adding clay pots and expanding the feature by adding clay flower pots as well.

To create a decorated pot, you now must first craft a clay pot, which when placed can have sherds placed on it.
To remove a sherd from a clay pot, use a brush on it. A clay pot or clay flower pot can be fired by placing it near
a fire or campfire for 10 seconds. Sherds can be placed on a clay pot at any time during the firing process.

The blocks that can be used to fire a clay pot can be customized with a tag located at:
`data/fired_pots/tags/block/fires_clay_pot.json`

### **üîß For Developers**

To add a new texture for your sherd when it is used on a clay pot, simply call
`ClayPotSherdTextureRegistry.INSTANCE.register()` in your client initializer and pass in the sherd item and texture
location relative to: `textures/entity/clay_pot/`. If a texture is not registered, it will attempt to get the texture
used for the decorated pot.

Additionally, make sure the sherd is also in the `minecraft:tags/item/decorated_pot_sherds` item tag so the sherd can be
placed on clay pots.
